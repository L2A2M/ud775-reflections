Q1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A1. When a repository is initialized, .git directory gets created.  I need to do it because the meta data needs to be stored.

Q2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A2. I think staging area provides a means to group files for a single commit.

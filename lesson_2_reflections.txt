Q1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A1. When a repository is initialized, .git directory gets created.  I need to do it because the meta data needs to be stored.

Q2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A2. I think staging area provides a means to group files for a single commit.

Q3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
A3. Since there is only one staging area, files not belong to the logical change should not be added to there in order to ensure the commit corresponding only to the logical change.
